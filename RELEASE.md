---

## Release 2.3.8 (September 3, 2024)
**Released and immediately removed due to bug with light program 0.**

---

## Release 2.3.7 (June 11, 2024)
* Fix for Pentair VSP losing connection & bouncing SWG to 0 and back.
* Added more VSP data (Mode, Status, Pressure Curve, both RPM & GPM) for all Pentair Pumps (VS/VF/VSF).
* Updates to HomeAssistant integration.
  * Will now convert from C to F so setting `convert_mqtt_temp_to_c` doesn't affect Hassio anymore

  * armhf = any Pi (or equiv board) running 32 bit Debian based OS, stretch or newer
  * arm64 = Pi3/4/2w running 64 bit Debian based OS, buster or newer

---

## Release 2.3.5 (May 23, 2024)
* Added Home Assistant integration through MQTT discover
  * Please read the Home Assistant section of the [Wiki - HASSIO](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#HASSIO)
  * There are still some enhancements to come on this.
* Included Docker into main releases
  * Please read Docker section of the [Wiki - Docker](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#Docker)
* Added support for reading extended information for Jandy JXi heaters.

---

## Release 2.3.4 (May 13, 2024)
* Changes for Docker
* Updated simulator code base and added new simulators for AllButton, OneTouch & PDA.
  * `<aqualinkd.ip>/allbutton_sim.html`
  * `<aqualinkd.ip>/onetouch_sim.html`
  * `<aqualinkd.ip>/aquapda_sim.html`
    * On PDA only panel AqualinkD has to share the same ID with the PDA simulator. Therefore AqualinkD will not respond to commands while simulator is active.
* Now you can completely program the control panel with the simulators removing the need to have a Jandy device.

---

## Release 2.3.3 (May 30, 2024)
* Introduced Aqualink Manager UI `http://aqualink.ip/aqmanager.html`
  * [AqualinkD Manager](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#AQManager)
* Moved logging into systemd/journal (journalctl) from syslog
  * [AqualinkD Log](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#Log)
* Updated scheduler
  * [AqualinkD Scheduler](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#Scheduler)
* Introduced RS485 frame delay / timer. 
  * Improve PDA panels reliability (PDA panels are slower than RS panels)
  * Potentially fixed Pentair VSP / SWG problems since Pentair VSP uses a different protocol, this will allow a timed delay for the VSP to post a status messages. Seems to only affect RS485 bus when both a Pentair VSP and Jandy SWG are present.
  * Add `rs485_frame_delay = 4` to /etc/aqualinkd.conf, 4 is number of milliseconds between frames, 0 will turn off ie no pause.
* PDA Changes to support SWG and Boost.

---

## Release 2.3.2 (July 8, 2023)
* Added support for VSP on panel versions REV 0.1 & 0.2
* Can change heater slider min/max values in web UI. `./web/config.js`

* Fix bug in IntelliBrite color lights
* Install script checks for cron and its config (needed for scheduler)
* serial-logger will now give recommended values for aqualinkd.conf

---

## Release 2.2.1 (August 2020)
* Supports serial adapter protocol `rssa_device_id` (provides instant heater setpoint changes & setpoint increment)
* Can use separate threads for network & RS485 interface. (optimization for busy RS485 bus implementations)
* Display messages now posted to MQTT
* Finalized all pre-release work in 2.2.0(a,b,c)
* Optimized the USB2RS485 Serial adapter logic.
* Logging bitmasks to focus debugging information
* Serial Logger changes to test for speed / errors & busy network bus
* Changed raw RS485 device reading, to specific devices rather than all
  * Change `read_all_devices` & `read_pentair_packets` to `read_RS485_swg`, `read_RS485_ePump`, `read_RS485_vsfPump`
  * Since you can now target specific device, we've reverted back to displaying the real information of the device & not trying to hide it like the panel does. Please see wiki config section for more details

* Extensive work to reduce CPU cycles and unnecessary logic.
* iAqualink Touch protocol supported for VSP & extended programming.
  * This protocol is a lot faster for programming, ID's are between 0x38 & 0x3B `extended_device_id`, use Serial_logger to find valid ID.
  * If your panel supports this it's strongly recommended to use it and also set `extended_device_id_programming=yes`
* New panel config procedure VERY dependent on panel type, you must change config, must set `panel_type` in config.
  * Buttons (specifically) heaters will be different from previous versions. (all info in wiki link above) 
* Simulator support removed for the moment.
* Few changes in RS protocol and timings.
* Fixed bug with Watts display for VSP.

* Fix SWG in homekit sometimes displaying wrong value. 
  * **Note to Homekit users:** Upgrading to 1.3.5c (and above) will add an additional SWG PPM tile (look in default room). You'll need to update homebridge-aqualinkd to 0.0.8 (or later) to remove the old PPM tile (or delete your homebridge cache). This is due to a bug in homebridge-aqualinkd < 0.0.7 that didn't delete unused tiles.
* Logic for SWG RS485 checksum_errors.

  * **Note:** At present only Pentair VSP is supported. If you have Jandy VSP (ePump) and are willing to do some testing, please post on forum as we'd like to get this supported as well.
  * For VSP you will need to check configuration for `read_all_devices = yes` & `read_pentair_packets = yes` and assign RS485 Pump ID to Device ID in configuration. Serial_logger should find ID's for you.
  * WebUI will display Pump RPM only. RPM, Watts and GPH information is also available from MQTT & API.
