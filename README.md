### AqualinkD new home
AqualinkD has grown over the years and now has multiple repositories for software / hardware. We are brining them all together under one organization. [AqualinkD home page (under construction)](https://www.aqualinkd.com) -or- [AqualinkD organization](https://github.com/aqualinkd).<br>
AqualinkD will always be open source and so will every associated repository. Nothing will change from that perspective. You will always be able to run this on cheap off the shelf hardware.

### Simulators
Designed to mimic AqualinkRS devices, used to fully configure the master control panel<br>

### In Apple Home app.
<img src="extras/HomeKit2.png?raw=true" width="800"></img>
* (NOTE: Salt Water Generator is configured as a Thermostat.  It is the closest homekit accessory type; so &deg;=% and Cooling=Generating).
* Full support for homekit scenes: ie: Create a "Spa scene" to: "turn spa on, set spa heater to X temperature and turn spa blower on", etc etc).

### In Home Assistant

    * about Heat vs Heater

# Call for Help.
* The only Jandy devices I have not decoded yet are LX heater & Chemical Feeder. If you have either of these devices and are willing to post some logs, please let me know, or post in the [Discussions area](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/discussions)

# <span style="color: red;">Notice</span>

AqualinkD will soon be dropping support for OS's older than debian bullseye. (GLIBC 2.31 will be minimum).

AqualinkD will be moving over to github hosted runners for compiling, currently AqualinkD is using self hosted. This means supporting old OS releases like Stretch is not worth it. AqualinkD will still be tested and support local compiling on old OS's, just the binaries in the release packages will be for bullseye and newer

<!-- 
NEED TO FIX NEXT THIS RELEASE.

Panel = RS-2/6 Dual will not have spa on auto config. (fine after saving config and restart).
Need to fix SWG when it's set to 0, thinks it's off and can't change, if it states 0 need to be enable, if blank turn off.
Need to look at sub panel (combined panels)
when serial port is wrong, can't edit config.
